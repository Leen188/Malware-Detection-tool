Project Overview:
This project aims to develop a malware detection system using machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques to enhance security by detecting and analyzing malware in emails, URLs, and files.

Features:
- Multi-Modal Detection: Utilizes ML and AI algorithms to scan and analyze phishing emails, URLs, and malicious code in PDF files.
- Phishing Email Detection: Filters out phishing emails by analyzing email body text using advanced ML classifiers.
- URL Spoofing Detection: Detects spoofed URLs, protecting users from accessing malicious websites.
- PDF Malicious Code Detection: Scans PDF files for JavaScript malicious code to ensure device and data safety.

Usage:
1. Access the web application.
2. Upload files, enter URLs, or paste email content to initiate malware detection.
3. Monitor analysis and take necessary actions based on detection results.

Contributing:
Contributions are welcome via pull requests for feature enhancements, new detection capabilities, or UI improvements.
