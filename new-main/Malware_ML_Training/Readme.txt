THE USED ML MODELS IS XGBClassifier FOR URL SCAN  AND SVC

URL

why we used it ?

 The XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting) classifier is indeed a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used for phishing detection. It can be trained to detect phishing websites by analyzing the characteristics of the input URL provided by the user.

For instance, a function can be defined that analyzes various characteristics of an input URL (like whether the URL has an IP address in it, does it use URL Shortening Services like TinyURL, does it have a HTTPS token, age of the URL’s domain, does it have a trusted Certificate Authority, etc.) and generates a 2D numpy array corresponding to the input URL which contains elements based on whether the corresponding characteristic is phish/unsafe, suspicious or safe.

Then, a XGBoost model can be built and a dataset can be obtained to train it and validate its performance. After the model is trained, the testing set can be used to get its classification from the model and compare it with the original testing set classifications. Finally, the 2D numpy array generated can be passed to the trained model to get the prediction whether the URL is of a phishing website or not.

This approach can help in creating a good fraud prevention system that can save consumers or customers millions of dollars per year. It’s a great example of 
 how AI or machine learning can be applied to a real-world project

Files
.........
The Support Vector Classifier (SVC) is a powerful machine learning algorithm that can be used for file analysis¹². Here are some reasons why it's good for this purpose:

1. **Effective in High Dimensional Spaces**: SVCs are effective in cases where the number of dimensions is greater than the number of samples². This makes it suitable for file analysis where a file can be represented as a high-dimensional vector.

2. **Memory Efficient**: SVCs use a subset of training points in the decision function (called support vectors), so it is also memory efficient². This is beneficial when dealing with large files or datasets.

3. **Versatile**: Different Kernel functions can be specified for the decision function². This allows the SVC to adapt to different types of data and problems.

4. **Robustness**: SVCs are known for their robustness while dealing with data¹. They can handle noise and outliers in the data, which is common in real-world file analysis tasks.

However, it's important to note that if the number of features is much greater than the number of samples, avoiding over-fitting in choosing Kernel functions and regularization term is crucial². Also, SVCs do not directly provide probability estimates, these are calculated using an expensive five-fold cross-validation².
